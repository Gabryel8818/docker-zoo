Combined JAAS Modules
=====================

This configuration uses LDAP with a property file fall-back.

The `build` user exists in LDAP, and the `admin` user is in the `realm.properties` file.

**LDAP User:**
`username: build`
`password: build`

**Property File User:**
`username: admin`
`password: admin`
